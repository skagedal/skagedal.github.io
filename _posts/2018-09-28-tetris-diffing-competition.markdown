[My post](https://skagedal.github.io/2018/08/23/collection-view-tetris.html) about Collection View Tetris was picked up as the "and finally..." entry by the ever-awesome news letter [iOS Dev Weekly](https://iosdevweekly.com/issues/371)! Nice. 

This prompted me to finish up a little follow-up: a comparison of available Table View and Collection View diffing frameworks with a very specific evaluation criteria: are they ready for the Tetris Challenge? 

[See the results](https://github.com/skagedal/TetrisDiffingCompetition) and test the game with the various diffing engines on Github.
